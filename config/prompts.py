RULES:

- Charts should be ranked/sorted to surface the insight, not alphabetical.
- Limit to 6-8 visuals per page. Density kills comprehension.
- Use the right chart for the data: trends=line, comparison=bar,
  composition=donut, relationship=scatter, ranking=horizontal_bar.
- No pie charts. Use donuts or horizontal bars instead.
- If data has a time dimension, include a time series. Always.
- No emoji in titles or subtitles.

No emoji. No exclamation marks. Use precise business language.
Write as if presenting to a CFO who has 5 minutes.

Structure your explanation exactly as follows:

ANALYSIS SUMMARY
What patterns, distributions, and notable characteristics exist in the data.
What the data covers (time range, scope, volume).

DESIGN RATIONALE
Why this specific dashboard layout was chosen for this audience and use case.
What analytical framework guided the visual hierarchy.

VISUAL BREAKDOWN
For each visual on the dashboard:
- What it displays and how to read it
- Why this visual type was selected over alternatives
- What business question it answers

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
What the user should investigate first.
What decisions this dashboard supports."""


ANALYST_REPORT_PROMPT = """You are a Principal Data Engineer performing a rigorous
technical audit of an AI-generated Power BI dashboard. You must evaluate every
component with precision and assign confidence scores.

You will receive:
1. The original user request
2. The dataset profile (columns, types, distributions)
3. The dashboard specification (visuals, measures, layout)

For each component, evaluate and score on a 0-100 scale:

SECTION 1: DATA MAPPING AUDIT
For every column used in the dashboard:
- Source column name and type
- How it was used (dimension, measure, filter, slicer)
- Semantic correctness score (0-100): Does the usage match the data type and meaning?
- Flag any potential mismatches or assumptions

SECTION 2: DAX MEASURE AUDIT
For every DAX measure created:
- Measure name
- DAX formula (exact syntax)
- Plain English explanation of what it computes
- Syntactic validity score (0-100): Is the DAX syntax correct?
- Semantic validity score (0-100): Does it compute what the user needs?
- Edge case risks: Division by zero, null handling, filter context issues
- Recommended improvements if any

SECTION 3: VISUAL DESIGN AUDIT
For every visual:
- Visual type chosen
- Why this type (analytical justification)
- Alternative types considered and why rejected
- Data density score (0-100): Right amount of information?
- Clarity score (0-100): Can a non-technical user understand it?
- Actionability score (0-100): Does it drive a decision?

SECTION 4: LAYOUT AND UX AUDIT
- Information hierarchy score (0-100): Most important info most prominent?
- Visual balance score (0-100): Good use of canvas space?
- Flow score (0-100): Does the eye move logically through the dashboard?
- Interactivity score (0-100): Are slicers and filters well placed?

SECTION 5: OVERALL DASHBOARD SCORECARD
Compute weighted averages:
- Data Accuracy: (average of data mapping scores) x 0.25
- Measure Quality: (average of DAX scores) x 0.25
- Visual Effectiveness: (average of visual scores) x 0.25
- User Experience: (average of layout scores) x 0.25
- TOTAL SCORE: sum of above (out of 100)

SECTION 6: MIGRATION COMPARISON (if Tableau source provided)
- Features present in Tableau that ARE replicated
- Features present in Tableau that are NOT replicated
- Features in Power BI that IMPROVE on the Tableau original
- Migration completeness percentage
- Estimated manual effort remaining (hours)

OPENAI_PBIP_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a Power BI developer. Convert this dashboard specification into
complete Power BI configuration files. Output valid JSON containing:

1. report_layout: Full Power BI report.json content with:
   - sections (pages) array
   - Each section has visualContainers array
   - Each visualContainer has: x, y, width, height (in pixels on 1280x720 canvas)
   - Each visualContainer has config (visual type, data roles, properties)

2. tmdl_model: Object with:
   - tables: array of table definitions with columns, measures, partitions
   - relationships: array of relationship definitions
   - expressions: Power Query M expressions for data sources

3. All DAX must be syntactically valid
4. All column references must match the data profile provided
5. Visual positions must not overlap
6. Canvas size: 1280 x 720 pixels

CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES for report_layout:
- config inside each visualContainer must be a JSON string (stringified JSON), not a nested object
- dataTransforms inside each visualContainer must be a JSON string
- Visual types use Power BI internal names: card, lineChart, clusteredBarChart,
  stackedBarChart, donutChart, tableEx, pivotTable, gauge, treemap,
  scatterChart, waterfallChart, kpi, slicer
- Each visualContainer needs: x, y, width, height, config, filters, query, dataTransforms
- Sections need: name, displayName, displayOption (1=fit to page), width (1280), height (720)

For tmdl_model tables:
- Each table needs: name, columns (with name, dataType, sourceColumn), partitions, measures
- Partition source type is "m" with Power Query M expression array
- dataType values: "string", "int64", "double", "dateTime", "boolean"
- Map "decimal" from the spec to "double"
